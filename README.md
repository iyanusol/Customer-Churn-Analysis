## Customer Churn Analysis – Tableau

### Business Problem
Customer churn impacts revenue and long-term growth. This project analyzes customer behavior to identify key churn drivers and provide actionable retention strategies.

### Tools Used
- Tableau Public
- Data Cleaning (pre-processed dataset)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization & Storytelling

### Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn than yearly or two-year contracts
- Customers with electronic check payment methods churn at higher rates
- Churn is highest in early tenure stages, especially under high monthly charges
- Long-tenure customers are less price-sensitive

### Recommendations
- Incentivize contract upgrades from month-to-month to annual plans
- Introduce early-tenure retention offers
- Reassess pricing for high-risk payment segments
